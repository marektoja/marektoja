Few years ago I have graduated from WAT, I have studied there Electronics and Telecommunication.

Currently I am studying Computer Science at PK and I am learning programming languages - mainly C++.

My respositories contain code written by me as a practical exercises from book: "Programowanie. Teoria i praktyka z wykorzystaniem C++" written by Bjarne Stroustrup.
